## SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFE CYCLE (SDLC)

### Stage 1: Goal Definition  
The goal of this task was to create a minimal Python program that confirms proper setup of the programming environment and demonstrates basic output functionality.

---

### Stage 2: Program Layout Design  
The application was structured as a single Python script containing one output statement. This approach ensured simplicity, readability, and ease of execution.

---

### Stage 3: Code Construction  
The program was developed using Python by implementing the built-in `print()` function to display the message “Hello, World” on the screen.

---

### Stage 4: Execution Testing  
The script was executed in a Python interpreter to verify that it runs successfully and displays the correct output without errors.

---

### Stage 5: Publication  
The completed script was uploaded to a public GitHub repository, making it available for assessment and fulfilling the requirements of the SEN 201 task.
